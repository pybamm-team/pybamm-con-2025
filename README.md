# PyBaMM Conference 2025

This repository contains the code for the PyBaMM Conference and Training Workshop 2025. Visit the [website](https://www.pybmc.com/) for more information.

## Training 

The training will be split into two parallel sessions: session one will follow the [PyBaMM developer course](https://train.rse.ox.ac.uk/material/HPCu/libraries/pybamm-developer) developed by the University of Oxford; session two will be more unstructured is and aimed at more advanced users. 

In the second session, attendees are expected to bring their own problems to work on and members of the PyBaMM team will be on hand to support and debug any issues. At the start of the second session, members of the PyBaMM team will walk through the notebooks in the "advanced stream" folder. These notebooks are split into two sessions:
- Advanced experiments: custom conditions & terminations, working with long experiments, and optimising performance
- Practical applications: working with model outputs and input parameters
